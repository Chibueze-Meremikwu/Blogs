I learned CIT 160 with zartosky from CSUN which introduced me into linux entirely, I was amazed by it and found my self bored of looking into the terminal all the time. So I looked deeper into Linux and cam accros distros that had different operation packages more suitable for me. Im currently using ubuntu on docker and on oracle virtual machine.
