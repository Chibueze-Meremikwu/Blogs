I learned about Git version control system and how its used to maintain vast majority of code without disruption between group members who are controlling it. 

I know the commands like "Git add .", "Git push origin", "Git Commit -m", "Git checkout branch" etc

I wrote my first blog on a editor called visual code integrated it with Git, After writing it on my terminal I inputted "git status" to see what was on my plate then "git add ." then "git commit -m" then finally "git push origin" to send my code to my github repository.
